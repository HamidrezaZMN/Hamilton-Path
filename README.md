# What-Is-This
A hamilton path is a path in chess, which starts from one point and ends to that point (moving like horse) with two conditions:<br>
1.Each check can be touched only one time.<br>
2.All the checks should be touched.<br>

# How-To-Use
When you run the package, a window pops up and wants you to enter a coordinate.<br>
After that each time you press Start button a new path (starting from the coordinate you entered) will be generated randomly.<br>
You can also clear the board and do the things yourself, which means if you click a check, the next checks that you can go will be highlighted and you make the path yourself (if you can :D)
